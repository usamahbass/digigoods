TASK SUBMISSION NOTES - DIGIGOODS API AUGMENT CODE HANDS-ON
================================================================

TASK OVERVIEW:
- Modify guidelines document in the hands-on project
- Implement a new simple feature and generate tests using Augment Code
- Observe and document whether generated code follows the modified guidelines

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
==================
- Spring Boot 3.5.4 application with Java 21
- PostgreSQL database with Liquibase migrations
- JWT-based authentication
- Maven build system with Checkstyle and JaCoCo coverage
- Main packages: controller, service, repository, model, dto, exception, security, config

EXISTING SERVICES & CLASSES:
============================
Controllers:
- AuthController (login/authentication)
- CheckoutController (order processing)
- DiscountController (discount management)
- ProductController (product listing)
- GlobalExceptionHandler (error handling)

Services:
- AuthService (authentication logic)
- CheckoutService (order processing business logic)
- DiscountService (discount validation and application)
- JwtService (JWT token management)
- ProductService (product operations)

Models:
- User, Product, Discount, Order
- DiscountType enum (PRODUCT_SPECIFIC, GENERAL)

EXISTING TEST COVERAGE:
=======================
Current test files:
- DigigoodsApplicationTests.java (basic context loading)
- AuthControllerIntegrationTest.java
- DiscountControllerIntegrationTest.java
- ProductControllerIntegrationTest.java
- ExceptionClassesTest.java
- JwtServiceTest.java
- ProductServiceTest.java

Missing test coverage for:
- CheckoutService (main business logic)
- DiscountService (discount validation)
- AuthService (authentication logic)
- CheckoutController (integration tests)

TASK 1: MODIFY GUIDELINES DOCUMENT
==================================
File to modify: HANDS-ON.md
Current guidelines location: Section 2.1 mentions .augment-guidelines.md

Key areas to enhance in guidelines:
1. Testing conventions (already has basic JUnit 5 rules)
2. Code style requirements (Lombok usage, checkstyle compliance)
3. Coverage requirements
4. Integration test patterns
5. Error handling patterns

Suggested modifications:
- Add specific naming conventions for test methods
- Include requirements for mock usage patterns
- Add validation rules for edge cases
- Specify assertion patterns and error message formats

TASK 2: IMPLEMENT NEW SIMPLE FEATURE
====================================
Potential new features to implement:
1. Order history endpoint (GET /orders/{userId})
2. Product search functionality (GET /products/search?name=...)
3. Discount usage statistics (GET /discounts/{code}/usage)
4. User profile management (GET/PUT /users/{id})
5. Product stock check endpoint (GET /products/{id}/stock)

Recommended: Product search functionality
- Simple to implement
- Clear business value
- Good test coverage opportunities
- Follows existing patterns

Implementation plan:
1. Add search method to ProductRepository
2. Add search method to ProductService
3. Add search endpoint to ProductController
4. Create appropriate DTOs if needed

TASK 3: GENERATE TESTS WITH AUGMENT CODE
========================================
Focus areas for test generation:
1. Unit tests for the new feature
2. Integration tests for the new endpoint
3. Edge case testing (empty results, invalid parameters)
4. Error handling scenarios

Test types to generate:
- Unit tests with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests using MockMvc
- Parameterized tests for various scenarios
- Exception handling tests

OBSERVATION CHECKLIST:
=====================
Guidelines compliance to observe:
□ Test method naming follows Given-When-Then format
□ @DisplayName annotations are used appropriately
□ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern is followed with comments
□ JUnit 5 features are used correctly
□ Mock usage follows project patterns
□ Checkstyle compliance is maintained
□ Lombok usage is appropriate
□ Error handling follows project conventions

Code quality aspects to note:
□ Test coverage percentage improvement
□ Test readability and maintainability
□ Proper use of Spring Boot test annotations
□ Appropriate assertion methods
□ Mock verification patterns
□ Test data setup patterns
